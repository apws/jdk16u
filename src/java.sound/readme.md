Decoupled javax.sound package as java.sound module. Tested build on Windows, Linux, MacOS (bash configure, make images)
Original java.desktop module transitively depends on java.sound module here.

Single thing to solve is MOVED DEPRECATED INTERFACE java.applet.AudioClip into javax.sound.sampled.AudioClip, for now. Internally, its referenced correctly, but for dependent apps, it may fail and needs source change and recompile. In history, there was internal AppletAudioClip class in java.base module, which was recently removed which introduced dependency of small javax.sound on big desktop. Final solution for compatible decoupling needs some kind of such internal base interface in java.base to be extended or removal of this applet related deprecated interface at all. This is only EXPERIMENTAL build to test feasibility of such change to introduce java.sound as module, potentially reimplementable also for different platforms than desktop (Android, iOS on Gluon - by native builds using GraalVM for mobile devices).
